## Overview

MathGPT is a Chrome extension that provides a convenient math symbol toolbox for ChatGPT. It allows users to easily insert mathematical symbols, Greek letters, and other special characters into their ChatGPT conversations without having to search for or remember Unicode characters.

## Features

- **Floating Symbol Panel**: Access a comprehensive collection of mathematical symbols with a single click
- **Categorized Symbols**: Symbols are organized into intuitive categories:
  - Basic Symbols (±, ×, ÷, etc.)
  - Calculus (∫, ∂, ∑, etc.)
  - Algebra (√, ∛, ², etc.)
  - Geometry (∠, °, △, etc.)
  - Sets (∈, ⊂, ∪, etc.)
  - Logic (∧, ∨, ¬, etc.)
  - Greek Letters (α, β, γ, etc.)
- **Customizable Display**: Enable or disable specific symbol categories based on your needs
- **Easy Copy**: Click any symbol to copy it to your clipboard
- **Tooltips**: Hover over symbols to see their names/descriptions
- **Unobtrusive Design**: The panel stays hidden until you need it
